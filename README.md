You can create a complex query using nested SQL, if close, where, loops, and joins that can join two tables or multiple tables, and base it on important data and information that seems significant to stakeholders. The stakeholders can then use that information and the provided report to implement important strategies and make decisions for improvement after viewing the provided report from their stored databased systems.
